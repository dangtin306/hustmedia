                        FAQ <br>
                        A detailed description of the project
    <br><br>
    The project was established with the purpose of creating an e-commerce website. Because of the technical difficulty the project has split into several steps to develop . On the browser you can access the web to use the full features on the android and iphone apps you can download from the app store with limited functionality because of technical limitations. The android app is distributed by us as a platform to help users buy and sell digital products. On ios we will provide bio link creation feature to help people easily share useful information with friends.

    Who We Are:
    <br><br>
    We are group of students from hust university. With a passion for digital, we make a marketing communication product to make a profit and continue with our passion.
    
    <br><br>
    Why did Hust Media start a media marketing service??
    <br><br>
    
    Hust media has tried many ways of marketing communication. For example: running ads, posting, editing videos, making movies, calling for support from acquaintances, etc... but in general, without the support of interactions, the effect will not be good. so I created a community for people to help each other get followed
    <br><br>
    Why Hust Media works as an e-commerce site
    <br><br>
    With market research experience in my country is Vietnam. I realized that if there really was a commercially integrated application platform, it would be more user-friendly than just the available features. So the integration aims to make the project more attractive.
