  Why Hust Media started media marketing service on tiktok?
  <br><br>
  
  Hust media has tried many ways of marketing communication. For example: running ads, posting, editing videos, making movies, calling for support from acquaintances, etc... but in general, without the support of interactions, the effect will not be good. so I created a community for people to help each other get followed
  <br><br>
  Why Hust Media works as an e-commerce site
  <br><br>
  With market research experience in my country is Vietnam. I realized that if there really was a commercially integrated application platform, it would be more user-friendly than just the available features. So the integration aims to make the project more attractive.
